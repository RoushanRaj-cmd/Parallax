			Welcome Tech enthusiasts . This is a parallax website created by me.
      Currently I am learning C and Python besides Web development.
      Web dev really makes coding interesting as it makes us visualise our own designed webpage running on a web browser .
      I will definitely complete the 75 days challenge and hope that I would be able to design many cool websites in future.
